cool, so there are a number of things to take into consideration so we'll start with an overview. 

Overview 

The story of GTA V is, at its core, about 3 men with very different mindsets, personalities and motivations who all choose to engage in crime. 

It explores the impact this has on them as people, what they hope to achieve from it and how their decisions affect the people around them. 

Now we can talk about the individual playable characters.

Characters - Michael

The closest thing the game has to a "main character" is Michael and this is intentional. Michael is the glue that holds the trio - and by extension the story at large - together. 

In the trio of characters, Michael reflects the "ideal" life of a career criminal. He committed crimes, got rich doing so and never had to face the consequences of his actions. 

On paper, he should be living the perfect life but we know he isn't. That is because while Michael technically got everything he wanted, it was very much a monkey's paw. 

He has a nice house, nice cars, beautiful wife, two children. But his life is in shambles and it is because Michael's motivations were incredibly superficial. 

He is a man that thought happiness came from what you could get, but he never understood that happiness comes from inner peace and making meaningful connections to those in your life.  

He has stagnated, because all he knows is a life of crime and now he cannot be a criminal. 

He thinks getting back into that "line of work" is what will bring him joy, but that is only because he never truly "got out" of that life - he still has the same mindset he did all those years ago and it is what is causing his unhappiness.

Characters - Trevor 

Trevor is the foil to Michael, in many ways. 

Not only are their stories directly connected, but it is the connection they share that really kicks off the main events of the story.

On top of that, Trevor's reintroduction to Michael's life further solidifies the illusion of his "ideal" life, since Trevor is a disrupting agent of chaos and also proof that despite how it would seem Michael does - in fact - have to pay for his past transgressions. 

Finally, they are direct opposites of each other. Michael is a pragmatic, strategic and logical criminal who tries to do jobs cleanly with the least amount of harm done to others. 

Trevor is unpredictable and manic, often resorting to violence as soon as it becomes a viable option in the situation. 

In terms of Trevor as a character, he represents the "life long" career criminal. He doesn't have big hopes or dreams, he isn't in crime with the hope of getting out, crime IS his life. 

Trevor is sadistic, violent, belligerent and deranged. He thrives on the chaos of crime and is motivated by getting his next thrill rather than any long term plan. 

Trevor is a danger to himself and everyone who enters his social circle. He is a destructive force that only brings harm to those around him, but his chaotic nature also makes him an effective tool for those who can control him. 

Unlike Michael, Trevor never "stagnated" - he is and will always be exactly where he is in life and he is more than okay with that.

Character - Franklin

The final character is Franklin. While not the "main character" I would say Franklin fulfills the role of player surrogate. 

Franklin has the least complex backstory and is also the youngest, both on purpose. Though we play as all three characters, Franklin has the unique perspective of looking at Michael and Trevor from the outside which gives the player a unique perspective on those characters. 

Franklin represents the "aspirational" career criminal. The inexperienced criminal who is trying to find his way and hopefully make a better life for himself. 

There is a reason the game focuses on Franklin so much in the early game, because Franklin is entering the world of career crime for the first time. The small jobs he committed with Lamar pale in comparison to what he does now. 

Michael is Franklin's mentor and Trevor is the devil on his shoulder. Michael is trying to teach Franklin what he knows in the hopes Franklin will make better choices than he did - meanwhile, Trevor is trying to appeal to Franklin's worst impulses. 

The reason why it feels like Franklin's story "ends early" is because his story hasn't actually ended but his future cannot be addressed in the current story. 

Michael is 48, Trevor is 49 but Franklin is only 25. 

His story has barely started. If we were supposed to properly explore his story, it would need to be the whole game. Instead, we see the beginning of Franklin's story.

His Critiques 

To address his critiques directly.

1) "Franklin's story is just about getting out the hood"

That isn't what his story is about, that is his character motivation. It is the reason he turned to career crime. The man is essentially complaining that the character had a goal and achieved it. 

Franklin's story is much deeper than just his surface level motivation and it makes me think this guy missed some subtext. 

2) "Franklin is underused"

Franklin is actually one of the most utilized characters. He fills the roll of player surrogate, provides a unique perspective on the other two characters, has his own story, is a masterful parallel of Michael and allows for the exploration of the stories wider themes. 

3) "They didn't give him character development" 

If you think the Franklin you meet at the start of the game is the same Franklin at the end of the game, I think you missed a lot of his character growth. 

Franklin matures throughout the story. He becomes wiser, he becomes more resourceful, he becomes more confident, he learns more about himself and what he wants out of life.

The Franklin we meet at the start could never make that call we're presented with at the climax. (But we'll address that later.)

4) "They didn't give him any real character relationships" 

That's kind of the point. Franklin DIDN'T have people in his life. Nobody actually cared enough about Franklin to truly make connections with him. 

His aunt couldn't give less of a shit, Tanesha left him because she was aspirational and he was stagnant. 

Anybody else in his life were only concerned with what he could do for them (like his boss at the car mart). That is until he met Michael.

I'd say Michael and Lamar are the two main people in his life. Michael taking the role of mentor and Lamar being his best friend, but ultimately a negative influence. 

Him thinking that Lamar and Franklin growing apart is somehow a failing of the story rather than a incredibly important aspect of Franklin's story shows me that he is missing alot of text and subtext. (but I'll get into that in a bit).

5) "We didn't see him try to get Lamar out the hood" 

At this point I've come to realize he doesn't understand Franklin's story nor the fact that Franklin is a parallel of Michael.

Franklin CAN'T get Lamar out the hood, that is the whole problem. Its why they grew apart. Lamar didn't have the mindset to get out of his current situation.

Franklin tried on many occasions to convince Lamar to leave the petty crime behind and try to do other things but Lamar wouldn't listen.

Lamar is Franklin's Trevor. A life long career criminal who has no motivation to strive for more. 

Just like Trevor does to Michael, all Lamar does is make Franklin's life harder. 

Franklin has seen first hand what Trevor is like and how Trevor's actions and mere presence cause harm to Michael and he has come to realize that maintaining a relationship with Lamar has the potential to lead him down that same path. 

He hasn't cut Lamar off completely, but they have grown distant because they want different things.

Whether Franklin will eventually completely cut ties with Lamar isn't addressed in the main story, but is something you can think on as a player.

You can even act on it because you can make the decision to hang out with him to maintain the relationship, but you can also choose not to.

Also Tanesha is basically a parallel to Michael's wife. If Franklin could get her back...would it even be worth it? Would they actually be happy together? Can he be what she wants? Hell, is she really what Franklin wants?

6) "Majority of the game felt like a therapy session of Michael and Trevor" 

Well, yes. That is kind of the point. The relationship between them is a huge part of the story. 

Franklin didn't "take a back seat" when Trevor was introduced, his role in the story simply changed. 

Him being a "helping hand" to the two of them is part of his story, it shows Franklin's outsider perspective on these two and how their actions influence how he behaves and thinks. 

Also, is he complaining that the story...about 3 characters...focuses on 2 of the 3 characters more than 1 character? 

7) "Franklin was the main character for a while" 

I already addressed that in the Franklin Character section.

8) "They gave us his missions early to 'get him out the way'" 

Again, addressed in the Franklin Character section. They bring Franklin's story to a point where the focus can shift to the OTHER TWO MAJOR CHARACTERS. 

Come on man, were they not supposed to actually continue the main plot?

9) "Then they gave him the hardest decision in the entire game"

Yes, because unlike this guy the actual writers understood the purpose of Franklin as a character. 

Franklin is the player surrogate, so them giving him the decision makes sense. He is the 3rd party, the outsider looking in. 

On top of that, it is a huge character moment for Franklin. What will he choose? What kind of person will he be? How has he changed over the story? What does he think of Michael and Trevor? 

Franklin's decision is our decision because we see those characters through his eyes, despite the fact that we also play them.

From a story perspective, only Franklin could ever be given that choice. Michael and Trevor are too steeped in who they are, Franklin is still discovering himself - he isn't like them, he can choose who he wants to be. 

The fact that he doesn't realize that Franklin was given the hardest decision specifically because of who he is shows that he didn't understand Franklin or his role in the story.

In conclusion

My man media literacy need work.
